Potlatch
=============

This is my implementation of the Coursera "[Mobile Cloud Computing with Android](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36?utm_medium=listingPage)" capstone project (2014).

The initial requirement document and the final requirements (Basic and Functional requirements for final grading) are included in this folder.

There are two separate folders containing the Server and Client implementations.
